# Image Generative Model
7015 Group Project

# Demo
Run train_gans.py

# Implementation
Basic algorithms/models: VAE, GANs, DDPM

# Priority 1
Dataset: MNIST, EMNIST
We develop a handwriting generation model using three different approaches (VAE, GANs, DDPM) and compare their performance.

# Priority 2
Dataset: CIFAR-10
As an additional feature, we train models to generate images based on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Note that controlling output quality in this context is more challenging, so this serves as an extended component of our project.


# To Do 
# l1
EMNIST_Data_Preprocess.

# l2
Conditional_GAN development.
